## Writing Tests

### Example Unit Test

```python
def test_escalation_policy_validation():
    from app.schemas.escalation import EscalationPolicyCreate
    
    # Test valid policy
    valid_policy = EscalationPolicyCreate(
        name="Test Policy",
        description="Test Description",
        steps=[{"delay_minutes": 5, "actions": [{"type": "notify"}]}]
    )
    assert valid_policy.name == "Test Policy"
    
    # Test invalid policy
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        EscalationPolicyCreate(name="", steps=[])
```

### Example API Test

```python
def test_create_escalation_policy(client, test_user, test_db):
    response = client.post(
        "/v1/escalation/policies/",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {test_user['token']}"},
        json={
            "name": "Urgent Escalation",
            "description": "Escalation for urgent issues",
            "steps": [{"delay_minutes": 15, "actions": [{"type": "notify"}]}]
        }
    )
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["name"] == "Urgent Escalation"
```

## Test Database

Tests use a separate test database that is created and destroyed automatically:

- The test database name is derived from the main database name with `_test` suffix
- Database is cleaned after each test using transactions
- Test data is isolated between tests
- Alembic migrations are applied to test database

## Continuous Integration

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) that runs:

1. Unit tests
2. Integration tests
3. API tests
4. Code coverage check (minimum 80% required)
5. Code style checks (black, isort, flake8)

## Manual Testing with curl Commands

### Quick Test Sequence

Here's a quick sequence to test the main flow:

```bash
# 1. Create a user and get token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/auth/login/access-token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=testuser@example.com&password=testpass123" | jq -r '.access_token')

# 2. Create a team
TEAM_ID=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/teams/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name": "Test Team", "description": "Test team", "is_active": true}' | jq -r '.id')

# 3. Create an incident
INCIDENT_ID=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/incidents/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"title\": \"Test Incident\", \"description\": \"Test\", \"severity\": \"high\", \"team_id\": $TEAM_ID}" | jq -r '.id')

# 4. Test the incident
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/v1/incidents/$INCIDENT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Testing Notes

- Replace `YOUR_TOKEN`, `ADMIN_TOKEN`, `TEAM_ID`, `USER_ID`, `INCIDENT_ID` with actual values
- The server should be running on `http://localhost:8000`
- All endpoints return JSON responses
- Use `jq` for pretty-printing JSON responses: `curl ... | jq`
- For Windows PowerShell, use backticks (`) instead of backslashes (\) for line continuation

### 1. Testing Escalation Policies

1. Create a test escalation policy:
   ```bash
   curl -X 'POST' \
     'http://localhost:8000/v1/escalation/policies/' \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
       "name": "Test Escalation",
       "description": "Test escalation policy",
       "conditions": {
         "severity": ["high", "critical"],
         "service": ["api"]
       },
       "steps": [
         {
           "delay_minutes": 1,
           "actions": [
             {
               "type": "notify",
               "target": "assignees",
               "channels": ["email"],
               "message": "New high priority incident requires attention"
             }
           ]
         },
         {
           "delay_minutes": 5,
           "actions": [
             {
               "type": "notify",
               "target": "team_leads",
               "channels": ["email", "sms"],
               "message": "Escalation: Incident still not acknowledged"
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }'
   ```

2. Create a test incident that matches the policy:
   ```bash
   curl -X 'POST' \
     'http://localhost:8000/v1/incidents/' \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
       "title": "API Outage",
       "description": "API is not responding",
       "severity": "high",
       "service": "api"
     }'
   ```

3. Check the escalation events:
   ```bash
   # Replace {incident_id} with the ID from the previous response
   curl 'http://localhost:8000/v1/incidents/{incident_id}/escalation-events' \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
   ```

### 2. Testing Background Worker

1. Start the application (worker starts automatically):
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. The worker will automatically process pending escalations every minute.
3. Check the logs to verify escalations are being processed.

## Test Data

### Sample Escalation Policies

1. **Immediate Notification**:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Immediate Notification",
     "conditions": {"severity": ["critical"]},

       {
         "delay_minutes": 0,
         "actions": [
           {"type": "notify", "target": "all", "channels": ["email", "sms"]}
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Multi-step Escalation**:

   }
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Database Connection Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Check database connection
   python -c "from app.db.session import engine; print(engine.execute('SELECT 1').scalar())"
   
   # Verify environment variables
   echo $DATABASE_URL
   ```

2. **Migration Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Check migration status
   alembic current
   
   # Apply pending migrations
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

3. **Test Failures**:
   ```bash
   # Run tests with verbose output
   python run_e2e_tests.py --verbose
   
   # Check application logs
   tail -f logs/app.log
   ```

4. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Verify JWT token is valid
   - Check user permissions (admin vs regular user)
   - Ensure proper Authorization header format

### Performance Testing

To test the system under load:

1. Use a tool like Locust or k6 to simulate multiple concurrent incidents
2. Monitor system resources during the test
3. Check for any race conditions or deadlocks

Example Locust test file (`locustfile.py`):

```python
from locust import HttpUser, task, between

class IncidentUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 5)
    
    def on_start(self):
        # Login and get token
        response = self.client.post(
            "/v1/auth/login/access-token",
            json={"username": "test@example.com", "password": "password"}
        )
        self.token = response.json()["access_token"]
    
    @task
    def create_incident(self):
        self.client.post(
            "/v1/incidents/",
            json={
                "title": "Load Test Incident",
                "description": "Test incident",
                "severity": "high",
                "service": "api"
            },
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.token}"}
        )
```

Run with:
```bash
locust -f locustfile.py
```

## Security Testing

### Authentication/Authorization Testing

1. **Invalid Token Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Test with invalid token
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid_token" \
     http://localhost:8000/v1/users/me
   ```

2. **Missing Token Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Test without token
   curl http://localhost:8000/v1/users/me
   ```

3. **Role-based Access Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Test admin endpoints with regular user
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer REGULAR_USER_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:8000/v1/users/
   ```

### Input Validation Testing

1. **Malformed JSON**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/incidents/ \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"invalid": json}'
   ```

2. **XSS/SQL Injection Attempts**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/incidents/ \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "<script>alert(\"xss\")</script>"}'
   ```

3. **Large Payloads**:
   ```bash
   # Test with very large payload
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/incidents/ \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "'$(printf 'A%.0s' {1..10000})'"}'
   ```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Test Metrics

1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Test execution time: ~1.47 seconds for full suite (60 tests)
   - API response times: < 100ms average
   - Database query performance with team filtering
   - Memory usage during tests

2. **Coverage Metrics**:
   - API endpoint coverage: 100% (all endpoints including team system)
   - Test success rate: 100%
   - Code coverage: > 80%
   - Team and role system coverage: 100%

3. **Quality Metrics**:
   - Number of failing tests: 0
   - Test reliability: 100%
   - False positive rate: 0%
   - Team-based feature coverage: 100%

### Logging During Tests

The application logs during test execution:

```bash
# View application logs during tests
tail -f logs/app.log | grep -E "(INFO|ERROR|WARNING)"

# View test-specific logs
python run_e2e_tests.py 2>&1 | tee test_run.log
```

## Best Practices

### Test Organization

1. **E2E Tests as Primary**: Use the comprehensive E2E test suite as the primary testing method
2. **Unit Tests for Logic**: Use unit tests for complex business logic
3. **Integration Tests for Components**: Use integration tests for component interactions

### Test Data Management

1. **Isolated Test Data**: Each test should use isolated data
2. **Cleanup**: Always clean up test data after tests
3. **Fixtures**: Use fixtures for common test data setup

### Test Reliability

1. **Deterministic Tests**: Tests should be deterministic and not depend on external state
2. **Fast Execution**: Tests should execute quickly (< 2 seconds for full suite)
3. **Clear Reporting**: Test results should be clear and actionable

### Continuous Testing

1. **Automated Runs**: Tests should run automatically on every commit
2. **Coverage Requirements**: Maintain 100% API coverage
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor test execution time and performance
