    participant Incident as Incident Management
    
    Script->>Elastic: GET /api/apm/services
    Elastic-->>Script: List of services
    Script->>Incident: GET /v1/teams
    Incident-->>Script: List of teams
    Script->>Elastic: POST /api/alerting/rule
    Note over Script,Elastic: Create alert rules with webhook actions
    Elastic-->>Script: Rule created successfully
```

        Note over Elastic,Incident: Webhook with alert data
        Incident->>Incident: Create/Update incident
        Incident->>Incident: Assign to team
        Incident->>Incident: Check escalation policies
        Incident->>Team: Send notifications
    end
```

### **3. Escalation and Notification Flow**
```mermaid

    participant Incident as Incident Management
    participant Escalation as Escalation Engine
    participant Notification as Notification Service
    participant User as Team Members
    
    Incident->>Escalation: Check escalation policies
    Escalation->>Escalation: Find matching policies
    Escalation->>Escalation: Determine escalation targets
    Escalation->>Notification: Send escalation notification
    Notification->>User: Email notification
    Notification->>User: Slack notification
    Notification->>User: SMS (if critical)
```

## 📊 **Data Flow Architecture**

### **Alert Data Transformation**

    A[Elastic Alert] --> B[Webhook Payload]
    B --> C[Data Extraction]
    C --> D[Incident Creation]
    D --> E[Team Assignment]
    E --> F[Escalation Check]
    
    subgraph "Data Transformation"
        B --> G[Alert Name]
        B --> H[Severity]
        B --> I[Service Info]
        B --> J[Metadata]
        B --> K[Tags]
    end
    
    subgraph "Incident Data"
        D --> L[Title]
        D --> M[Description]
        D --> N[Severity]
        D --> O[Service]
        D --> P[Team ID]
        D --> Q[Alert ID]
    end
```

### **Configuration Hierarchy**
```mermaid

    A[Global Thresholds] --> D[Final Thresholds]
    B[Service-Specific Overrides] --> D
    C[Environment Overrides] --> D
    D --> E[Alert Rules]
    E --> F[Webhook Actions]
    
    subgraph "Configuration Sources"
        A
        B
        C
    end

        F
    end
```

## 🔧 **Key Components**

### **1. Elastic APM Alert Manager**
- **Service Discovery**: Queries Elastic APM for monitored services
- **Alert Rule Creation**: Creates alert rules with webhook actions
- **Team Mapping**: Maps services to incident management teams
- **Configuration Management**: Handles global and service-specific thresholds

### **2. Incident Management Webhook Handler**
- **Webhook Processing**: Receives and validates Elastic APM webhooks
- **Incident Creation**: Creates new incidents from alert data
- **Incident Updates**: Updates existing incidents with new alert information
- **Recovery Handling**: Automatically resolves incidents when alerts recover

### **3. Escalation Engine**
- **Policy Matching**: Matches incidents to escalation policies
- **Target Resolution**: Finds appropriate escalation targets
- **Timing Management**: Handles escalation delays and timeouts
- **Status Tracking**: Tracks escalation event status

### **4. Notification Service**
- **Multi-Channel Delivery**: Email, Slack, SMS, webhooks
- **User Preferences**: Respects user notification preferences
- **Template Management**: Handles notification templates
- **Delivery Tracking**: Tracks notification delivery status

## 🔄 **State Management**

### **Incident States**
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Triggered: Alert received
    Triggered --> Acknowledged: Manual acknowledgment
    Triggered --> Resolved: Alert recovery
    Acknowledged --> InProgress: Work started
    InProgress --> Resolved: Issue fixed
    Acknowledged --> Resolved: Alert recovery
    Resolved --> [*]
```

### **Escalation States**
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending: Escalation created
    Pending --> Active: Delay period expired
    Active --> Notified: Notifications sent
    Notified --> Resolved: Incident resolved
    Notified --> Escalated: Next escalation step
    Resolved --> [*]
    Escalated --> Pending: Next step pending
```

## 🔐 **Security and Authentication**

### **API Authentication**
- **Elastic APM**: API Key authentication for service discovery and alert creation
- **Incident Management**: Bearer token authentication for webhook endpoints
- **Team Mapping**: Secure configuration file with team assignments

### **Data Validation**
- **Webhook Payload**: Pydantic schema validation for all incoming webhooks
- **Configuration Files**: JSON schema validation for configuration files
- **User Permissions**: Role-based access control for incident management

## 📈 **Monitoring and Observability**

### **Integration Metrics**
- **Alert Creation Rate**: Number of alerts created per time period
- **Incident Creation Rate**: Number of incidents created from alerts
- **Escalation Rate**: Percentage of incidents that escalate
- **Resolution Time**: Time from incident creation to resolution
- **Webhook Success Rate**: Percentage of successful webhook deliveries

### **Error Handling**
- **Webhook Failures**: Retry logic for failed webhook deliveries
- **Configuration Errors**: Graceful handling of invalid configurations
- **Service Unavailability**: Fallback mechanisms for service outages
- **Data Validation Errors**: Detailed error logging for debugging

## 🚀 **Deployment Architecture**

### **Component Deployment**
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Elastic APM Cluster"
        A[Elasticsearch]
        B[Kibana]
        C[APM Server]
    end
    
    subgraph "Incident Management"
        D[FastAPI Application]
        E[PostgreSQL Database]
        F[Redis Cache]
    end
    
    subgraph "External Services"
        G[Email Service]
        H[Slack API]
        I[SMS Gateway]
    end
    
    C --> D
    D --> E
    D --> F
    D --> G
    D --> H
    D --> I
```

### **Configuration Management**
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration (API keys, tokens)
- **Configuration Files**: Non-sensitive configuration (thresholds, team mapping)
- **Database**: Dynamic configuration (escalation policies, user preferences)
- **Secrets Management**: Secure storage for credentials and tokens

**This architecture provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable integration between Elastic APM and the incident management system, ensuring reliable alert-to-incident workflows with full observability and control.**
